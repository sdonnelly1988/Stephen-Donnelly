The general aim of the project was to demonstrate that I could develop a
sound, effective software system to an identified problem and record this through a Master’s level
dissertation. A secondary aim of the individual software development project was to assist me in developing
the skills necessary to be an effective software developer.

This project focuses on the development of an online platform aimed at connecting tutors and
students, facilitating the arrangement of in-person lessons, and enhancing the overall tutoring
experience. Utilising modern web technologies and user-centred design principles, the platform allows
learners to find tutors within specified subjects, levels, and establish contact to arrange lessons. Key
functionalities include tutor and learner registration, browsing for tutors, lesson requests, and
communication features. Drawing on extensive user feedback from parents, teaching colleagues, and
friends, the platform has been iteratively refined to ensure optimal user experience and engagement.
This project showcases the potential of such a platform to support and empower educators and
learners alike in their pursuit of academic success through in-person tutoring.
